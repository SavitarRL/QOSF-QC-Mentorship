# Task 4: Maximum Independent Sets (MIS)
An independent set is a set of vertices in a graph such that no two of which are connected by an
edge. The problem of finding Maximum Independent Sets (MIS) is NP-hard. In this task, you will
solve small instances of the MIS with gate and analog-based quantum computing:
1) Create 4 graphs with 3, 5, 6, and 7 nodes. You can define the edges as you prefer.
2) For each graph, find the MIS using the following methods:
- a. The Gate-Based QAOA
- b. The Quantum adiabatic algorithm using analog based quantum computing. You
can check the documentation in Pulser and Blockade for references.

3) Compare the results
